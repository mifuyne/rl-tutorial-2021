Yikes, I waited too long to get this done! Trying to cram two parts worth of learning into my head was not ideal. I'm sure I'll forget something down the road and get confused.

I switched over to the 2020 roguelike tutorial, sadly. I don't have enough experience with Python (still a beginner really...) and my only experience with ECS was through Unity back in 2011.

The part that made my scratch my head for a while was the `action.perform` part of the code. I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out why that works. Eventually I found out that action contains the Action objects like `EscapeAction` and `MoveAction`. It was so obvious in hindsight, but at least I learned a neat trick!

The learning experience from this one is...read the code carefully! I left out "slice" in `procgen.py:31` and was wondering why was it only generating a row at the top and bottom instead of filling it in! Again, an embarrassing amount of time was spent before I figured that one out. Another lesson learned ðŸ™‚
