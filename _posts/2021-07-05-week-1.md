# Week 1

*Copied from https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/oa2g5r/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/h471rs6/*

First time I'm participating. I'm in the process of learning Python at the same time.

I'm actually using the 2021 revision (link at this comment: https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/oa2g5r/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/h3ndago/ )

I doubt I'll deviate much, if at all for this year. There are some concepts that I'm either really rusty on or not familiar with and I don't want to set myself up to fall into that pit of despair :P
